# My first Web Project

Before this I only participated in one project related to web. And in that project we focused on showing data on our page after accessing them from local SQL database. So this one can fairly be called my first project.

I chose [this project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27JtRAI3QO8) to follow, whose design is elegant and graceful.

Let's begin the journey!

This is a simple way to see outcomes immediately.

```bash
python -m http.server 8044

```

From today's practice, I found that frontend development is a work which needs much carefulness and patient. For me it's kinda tiresome to find the bug.

The most annoying thing that happened to me is that I have much trouble finding the reason why my css code does not work. My code seems to be exactly the same as in the video!
